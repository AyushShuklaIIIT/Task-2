# Task Manager

This project is a simple web-based To-Do List application that allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Enter new tasks and add them to your to-do list.
- **Mark as Complete:** Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks are visually highlighted.
- **Delete Tasks:** Easily remove tasks from your list with a delete button.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so your list is preserved even after refreshing the page.

## How it Works

- The main page (`index.html`) provides a simple interface to input and view tasks.
- The application's logic is handled in `script.js`, managing task addition, completion, deletion, and storage.
- The layout and styles are managed in `style.css` for a clean and user-friendly look.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a new task and click "Add Task" or press Enter.
3. Click on any task to mark it as complete.
4. Click "Delete" to remove a task from the list.
